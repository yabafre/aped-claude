CLI that scaffolds a complete, user-driven dev pipeline into any [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) project — 23 slash commands, two hooks (coherence guardrail + upstream-lock), named agent personas, coordinated teams, **parallel sprint** mode via `git worktree` with a Lead Dev coordinator, sprint **umbrella branch convention** so parallel sprints integrate via one reviewable PR per sprint, an **external ticket intake** (`/aped-from-ticket`) for tickets that bypass the planning flow, and **cross-tool skill distribution** via symlinks so OpenCode, Codex CLI, and any `agents.md` reader see the same skills as Claude Code.

```

## What it does

APED turns Claude Code into a disciplined, user-driven dev pipeline. Every phase produces an artifact, requires explicit user validation, and hands off via a guardrail hook that warns on skipped steps. Named agent personas run research, implementation, and review in parallel — with agent teams for anything that needs cross-specialist coordination.

## Quick start

```bash
cd your-project
npx aped-method
```

Interactive prompts (powered by [@clack/prompts](https://github.com/bombshell-dev/clack)) ask for project name, author, languages, ticket system, and git provider. Or go non-interactive:

```bash
npx aped-method --yes \
  --project=my-app --author=Jane \
  --lang=french --tickets=linear --git=github
```

Then open Claude Code:

```
/aped-brainstorm   # (Optional) Diverge first — 100+ ideas before converging
/aped-prfaq        # (Optional) Working Backwards — press-release-first discipline
/aped-analyze      # Start with guided discovery
```

### Optional: parallel sprints

Once you reach the sprint phase (after `/aped-epics`), you can run several stories in parallel via `git worktree`:

```
/aped-sprint     # DAG resolver + capacity check + dispatch
```

For the best experience, install [workmux](https://github.com/raine/workmux) (`brew install raine/workmux/workmux`) — APED detects it and will auto-create a tmux window with Claude Code pre-launched per story. Without workmux, `/aped-sprint` prints the exact `cd` + `claude` + `/aped-dev` commands to run in new terminals.

### Maintenance & optional add-ons

```bash
aped-method doctor                # verify an installed scaffold
aped-method statusline            # install the APED status line
aped-method safe-bash             # install the optional Bash safety hook
aped-method symlink               # repair APED skill symlinks
aped-method post-edit-typescript  # install the optional TS quality hook
aped-method verify-claims         # install the verification-gate advisory hook
aped-method session-start         # install the SessionStart skill-index hook
aped-method visual-companion      # install the brainstorm browser companion
```

Each opt-in subcommand also accepts `--uninstall` to remove its installed bits.

## Command catalog

APED ships 25 slash commands across the core pipeline, upstream ideation, critique, sprint operations, external-ticket intake, debugging, code-review reception, and maintenance flows. The detailed catalog is generated from the same `COMMAND_DEFS` source that produces the scaffolded slash commands, so it stays in sync as the product evolves.

See [`docs/COMMANDS.md`](./docs/COMMANDS.md) for the full generated catalog, including phase, arguments, purpose, and likely outputs.

## Operational commands

The CLI also includes a few maintenance subcommands for installed APED projects:

- `aped-method doctor` — verify the scaffold, hooks, state, commands, symlinks, and optional binaries
- `aped-method statusline` — install an APED-aware Claude Code status line (model · context-window progress bar · project · phase · epic · story · review queue · worktrees · git)
- `aped-method safe-bash` — install the optional Bash safety hook
- `aped-method symlink` — repair APED cross-tool skill symlinks
- `aped-method post-edit-typescript` — install the optional TypeScript post-edit quality hook
- `aped-method verify-claims` — install the verification-gate PostToolUse advisory hook (scans Bash output for forbidden completion phrases without evidence)
- `aped-method session-start` — install the SessionStart hook that injects `aped/skills/SKILL-INDEX.md` as `additionalContext` at session boot
- `aped-method visual-companion` — install the bash + python3 HTTP server (default port 3737) that powers `/aped-brainstorm`'s browser-based mockup/diagram rendering

## Personas & teams

APED runs work through **named agent personas** (BMAD-inspired) so each agent stays in character and focuses on its scope. The type of coordination depends on whether specialists need to talk to each other.

### Research subagents — `/aped-analyze`
Independent parallel work, no coordination needed.

- **Mary** — Senior Market Analyst. *"Show me the data, not the hype."*
- **Derek** — Domain Expert. *"I know where the bodies are buried."*
- **Tom** — Staff Engineer. *"Every choice has a tax."*

### Review specialists — `/aped-review`
Plain subagents (no `TeamCreate`, no `SendMessage`), dispatched in parallel. Each specialist returns its findings to the Lead, who merges and cross-references manually. Keeps the workflow focused on validation, avoids tmux-pane rendering issues of the experimental agent-teams mode, and scales to N specialists without a parallelism cap.

- **Eva** — AC Validator / QA Lead (always) — *"I trust nothing without proof in the code."*
- **Marcus** — Code Quality / Staff Engineer (always) — *"Security and performance are non-negotiable."*
- **Rex** — Git Auditor (always) — *"Every commit tells a story. Most lie."*
- **Diego** — Backend (if backend files touched)
- **Lucas** — Frontend (if frontend files touched)
- **Aria** — Visual / Design Engineer (frontend + preview app)
- **Kai** — Platform / DevOps (if infra files)
- **Sam** — Fullstack Tech Lead (if story spans ≥ 2 layers)

### Fullstack dev team — `/aped-dev` (optional mode)
Triggered when a story touches ≥ 2 layers. Contract-first coordination via `SendMessage`.

- **Kenji** — API Designer. Owns the oRPC/OpenAPI contract.
- **Amelia** — Senior Backend. Implements against Kenji's contract.
- **Leo** — Senior Frontend. UI against the contract + visual verification via React Grab.

### Architecture Council — `/aped-arch` (for high-stakes decisions)
Dispatched in parallel via `Agent` when a Phase-2 decision would cost weeks to reverse (primary database, auth model, API paradigm, frontend framework, infra platform). Each specialist thinks independently — no shared context, no convergence pressure — and returns a structured verdict (preferred option, rationale, top 2 risks, disqualifying conditions).

- **Winston** — Systems Architect (always included). *"Boring tech for MVP. Cleverness costs operationally."*
- **Lena** — Pragmatic Engineer. *"What ships fastest without regret?"*
- **Raj** — Security & Compliance Reviewer. *"Assume breach. Assume audit."*
- **Nina** — Cost & Ops Analyst. *"What does this cost at 10× scale? And when does it page us at 3am?"*
- **Maya** — Edge Case Hunter. *"Where does this break?"*

User picks the final option; the minority view gets documented as signal for future pivots. Escape hatch for MVP-scale decisions where the Council would be overkill.

### Retrospective specialists — `/aped-retro`
Three parallel subagents reading post-mortem data after an epic completes.

- **Mia** — Struggle Analyzer. Patterns across dev notes, review feedback, technical debt.
- **Leo** — Velocity & Quality Analyzer. Review rounds, complexity vs effort, quality signals.
- **Ava** — Previous-Retro Auditor. Continuity check — did the prior retro's action items actually ship?

### Tool surface used
`Agent` (all specialist dispatches), `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList` (sprint task tracking), plus `TeamCreate` / `TeamDelete` / `SendMessage` in `/aped-dev` fullstack mode only — because Kenji, Amelia and Leo genuinely co-edit a shared contract. Review is pure validation, so it skips the team machinery entirely.

## Design principles

### User controls the pace
No auto-chaining between phases. Every skill ends with "Run `/aped-X` when ready." The user decides when to proceed, review, or backtrack. GATE blocks (⏸) mark every write / state change that requires approval.

### A/P/C menu at every gate
Where a skill is about to commit a load-bearing artefact (PRD section, epic structure, architecture decision, retro action items, UX prototype, PRFAQ press release / internal FAQ), it presents the same menu and HALTs. `[A]` invokes `/aped-elicit` (advanced critique toolkit — socratic, pre-mortem, red team, tree of thoughts, etc.). `[P]` (where it appears) dispatches a multi-specialist sub-team via `Agent` (e.g., Sam + Eva + a PM persona to challenge the epic structure). `[C]` continues. Direct user feedback is always accepted as a fallback. Same vocabulary across the seven gated skills — mental model stays consistent.

### Conversational coaching, not silent generation
`/aped-brainstorm` Phase 3 generates ideas one element at a time with explicit HALT for the user's response, then reacts via three coaching patterns (basic answer → dig; detailed answer → build; stuck → seed). Energy checkpoint every 4-5 exchanges with [K]eep / [S]witch / [P]ivot / [D]one. End-of-technique menu with [K]eep / [T]ry new / [A]dvanced elicit / [B]reak / [C]onverge. Anti-bias domain pivot every 10 ideas. The "NEVER generate ideas in silent batches" rule is in Critical Rules.

### Headless mode for autonomous workflows
`/aped-prd --headless` and `/aped-prfaq --headless` skip every menu and produce the artefact straight-through, equivalent to the pre-3.9 behaviour, for CI / scripted workflows. Default mode is interactive with the A/P/C menus. `--plan-only` on `/aped-sprint` and `/aped-ship` is the symmetric flag on the sprint side: dry-run, prints the commands that would have run, no mutation.

### Binary review outcomes
`/aped-review` only transitions `review → done` (all findings resolved or dismissed) or stays `review` (user fixes and re-runs). No `in-progress`, no `[AI-Review]` purgatory.

### Visual verification as a first-class step
Frontend tasks get a visual check at **every GREEN pass**, not just at review time. `mcp__react-grab-mcp__get_element_context` inspects the live preview app; `/aped-review`'s Aria validates rather than re-running from scratch. Fallback: if MCP is unavailable, warn and defer to review — never block dev.

### Ticket system as source of truth
The Linear / Jira / GitHub / GitLab ticket is the shared artifact between the AI and the human team. `/aped-story`, `/aped-dev`, and `/aped-review` fetch the ticket at the start of each phase; any divergence with the local story halts the flow until the user resolves it.

### Input discovery — consume-everything-found
Every pipeline-phase skill starts with a glob-based discovery step that loads every upstream APED artefact present (`product-brief.md`, `prd.md`, `architecture.md`, `ux/`, `project-context.md`, `lessons.md`, completed `stories/`, etc.) before any work. Greenfield versus brownfield is **detected** from `project-context.md` presence, not declared via a separate command — `/aped-context` and `/aped-analyze` are not mutually exclusive entry points. Required prereqs hard-stop with a clear remediation message (e.g. architecture without a PRD), optional artefacts bias the workflow when present. The pattern is documented in `docs/dev/discovery-pattern.md`.

### Lessons feedback loop
`/aped-retro` writes scoped rules to `docs/aped/lessons.md` after each epic (`Scope: /aped-story | /aped-dev | /aped-review | all`). Those scopes are now the routing system the field always promised: `/aped-story`, `/aped-dev`, and `/aped-review` discover and apply lessons matching their scope at entry. A lesson scoped `/aped-review` becomes an explicit specialist check, not advisory text — if the relevant specialist can't confirm the rule was applied, that's a finding. The loop closes: each new epic carries the lessons of every prior epic, automatically.

### Guided discovery over questionnaires
`/aped-analyze` uses 4 rounds of conversational discovery — Claude probes deeper on vague answers and helps the user think through their project, instead of a flat list of questions. In brownfield mode (when `project-context.md` exists), the rounds reframe as "what's *new* relative to the existing system" rather than from-scratch ideation.

### Stories created one at a time
`/aped-epics` writes the plan (titles / ACs / scope) without creating per-story files. `/aped-story` produces one detailed story file right before implementation, grounded in upstream artefacts loaded by Input Discovery (PRD FRs, UX components, architecture patterns, project context, lessons, prior stories of the same epic).

### Epic context cache
Before implementing each story, `/aped-dev` checks `docs/aped/epic-{N}-context.md`. If missing or stale, a sub-agent compiles it once from PRD / architecture / UX / `project-context.md` (brownfield only) / `lessons.md` (scoped to `/aped-dev`) / completed stories / codebase patterns. Reused across every story in the epic — one compile, many reads.

### Spec isolation — `/aped-quick`
Quick specs are independent files with a status field (`draft → in-progress → done`). Multiple can run in parallel. Resuming an in-progress spec is automatic.

### External ticket intake — `/aped-from-ticket`
For tickets that bypass the planning flow — production bugs, partner asks, mid-sprint requests — `/aped-from-ticket <ticket-id-or-url>` is a single-shot bridge. It reads `ticket_system` from config (Linear / Jira / GitHub Issues / GitLab Issues — provider parity is mandatory; `none` is refused early), verifies the right toolchain is available (`gh`/`glab` CLI for github/gitlab, Linear MCP for Linear, Jira/Atlassian MCP for Jira), fetches the ticket, compiles project context (PRD overlap, architecture constraints, related stories, codebase patterns), drafts a project-conformant story collaboratively with a ⏸ GATE before writing, persists it under either an `external-tickets` bucket or an auto-matched epic, registers it in `state.yaml` with `source: from_ticket` (out-of-sprint by default — explicit promotion required), and ends with a 3-option handoff prompt (`[D]` run /aped-dev / `[P]` promote to active sprint / `[S]` stop). All knobs live under `from_ticket:` in `.aped/config.yaml` with sensible defaults; comment-back to the source ticket is opt-in.

### Parallel sprint via worktrees — `/aped-sprint` + `/aped-lead` + `/aped-ship`

When an epic has several stories ready to go, `/aped-sprint` resolves the story DAG (`depends_on:` in `epics.md` and `state.yaml`), then dispatches up to `parallel_limit` stories (default 3) — each in its own `git worktree` at `../{project}-{ticket}` on a story branch. Reviews are bounded too (`review_limit`, default 2) and spill to a `review-queued` status when the limit is reached. An `upstream-lock` PreToolUse hook denies any edit to `prd.md` / `architecture.md` / `ux/` while a story is in-progress; only `/aped-course` can temporarily unlock — and it notifies every active worktree ticket before and after the change.

**Sprint umbrella branch convention.** `/aped-sprint` creates `sprint/epic-{N}` from `origin/<base>`, pushes it, and records it in `state.yaml` at `sprint.umbrella_branch`. Story feature branches are cut from the umbrella (not from base). `/aped-review` opens story PRs with `--base $UMBRELLA`. As `/aped-lead` approves `review-done`, story PRs are merged into the umbrella au-fil-de-l'eau (one merge per approval). `/aped-ship` opens the final `gh pr create --base <base> --head sprint/epic-{N}` — base only ever sees commits via that one PR. Compatible with branch protection on main out of the box.

**Two-tier architecture: Lead Dev ↔ Story Leaders.** Stories don't run on autopilot. Each Story Leader (the Claude session inside a worktree) posts a check-in at every transition and HALTs:

- `story-ready` — posted by `/aped-story` at dispatch (worktree mode)
- `dev-done` — posted by `/aped-dev` when implementation + tests converge
- `dev-blocked` — posted by `/aped-dev` before HALT (new dep, repeat failure, ambiguity, missing config) — `/aped-lead` always escalates this one
- `review-done` — posted by `/aped-review` when the story flips to `done`

You run `/aped-lead` in the main project whenever you want to process the batch. The Lead Dev calls `.aped/scripts/check-auto-approve.sh` for **deterministic verdicts** (no LLM judgement on the auto-path): `story-ready` verifies the story file is committed + ACs use Given/When/Then + all `depends_on` are done; `dev-done` checks `.aped/.last-test-exit == 0` + tasks all `[x]` + clean tree + file list matches `git-audit.sh`; `review-done` verifies status `done` + no `aped-blocked-*` label + PR `MERGEABLE` + PR `baseRefName == umbrella`. Exit `0` = AUTO, exit `1` = ESCALATE with reasons. Approvals `tmux send-keys` the next command into the right worktree window (fallback: print the command for you to run manually).

**State.yaml authority is in main, divergence in worktrees is normal.** Each worktree writes its local state.yaml on its feature branch; main's copy is the authoritative one written by `/aped-lead`. `/aped-ship` resolves state.yaml conflicts at merge with `--ours` **by design**, not as a workaround. State.yaml carries `schema_version: 1` (validated by `validate-state.sh`; unknown versions exit 4 to force an explicit migration).

**`/aped-ship` flow.** Loads `sprint.umbrella_branch` → Integration Check (every done story merged into the umbrella, both `git branch --merged` and the `merged_into_umbrella` flag agree) → Composite Review on `origin/<base>..$UMBRELLA` (secrets scan, debug-marker scan, typecheck, lint, db:generate, state.yaml consistency, leftover worktrees) → push umbrella + print `gh pr create --base <base> --head $UMBRELLA` with the composite summary as the PR body. The skill never pushes to base, never mutates the umbrella content. Inboxes are archived to `.aped/checkins/archive/{date}/` so the next sprint starts fresh.

**Drift detection.** `.aped/scripts/check-active-worktrees.sh` reconciles `state.yaml` ↔ disk: for every story marked `in-progress | review-queued | review` with a non-null `worktree`, it verifies the path exists. `/aped-sprint` calls it before computing capacity (so a `rm -rf`'d worktree no longer holds a dispatch slot); `/aped-lead` and `/aped-status` surface the drift as a `✗ MISSING` row.

**Audit log.** `.aped/scripts/log.sh` appends JSONL events to `.aped/logs/sprint-{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl` — `checkin.sh` emits `post / approve / block / push` automatically; `sprint-dispatch.sh` emits `worktree_created`; skills emit `dispatch_started`, `merge_done`, `pr_recommended`. Best-effort, never fails the caller. Useful for postmortems on a botched sprint.

**`--plan-only`.** `/aped-sprint` and `/aped-ship` accept `--plan-only`: runs through Setup → Discovery / Capacity → Proposal / Findings, then STOPS before any mutation. Prints the commands that would have run. Use it for pre-flight inspection on a sensitive sprint.

**Dispatch has two paths**, picked automatically:

- **With [workmux](https://github.com/raine/workmux)** (recommended) — APED detects `workmux` in `$PATH` and calls `workmux add -a claude` per story. The Claude session sits idle in its tmux window until `/aped-lead` approves the `story-ready` check-in and pushes `/aped-dev {story-key}` via `tmux send-keys`. Live TUI dashboard via `workmux dashboard`, one-command cleanup via `workmux merge`. A starter `.workmux.yaml` ships at `.aped/templates/workmux.yaml.example`.
- **Without workmux** (fallback) — `.aped/scripts/sprint-dispatch.sh` creates the worktree + branch + marker file. `/aped-lead` still gates transitions but prints the exact commands for you to run manually in each worktree.

**Check-in backend.** Ticket system (Linear / GitHub / GitLab / Jira) with `aped-checkin-*` / `aped-approved-*` / `aped-blocked-*` labels + structured comments. If `ticket_system: none`, falls back to JSONL inboxes under `.aped/checkins/`. Concurrent-safe via a portable `mkdir`-based lock (macOS-compatible).

On macOS/Linux the scaffolder creates **relative symlinks** that point back to the canonical `.aped/aped-*` directories, one edit in `.aped/` propagates to every tool instantly — no manual sync, no drift. Since v3.7.5 the three targets are **auto-detected**: a symlink tree is created under `.opencode/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, and/or `.codex/skills/` **only when the corresponding `.opencode` / `.agents` / `.codex` marker directory already exists** in the project. A single-tool Claude Code project gets zero symlinks and zero slash-command duplication; multi-tool setups get symlinks only where they make sense.

Claude Code itself reaches APED via the real `.claude/commands/aped-*.md` files — `.claude/skills/` is intentionally **not** a default target (it would duplicate every slash command in the picker). Windows hosts are auto-skipped (symlinks require developer mode + `core.symlinks=true`). Fresh mode wipes stale `aped-*` entries in every location APED has ever written to (including legacy `.claude/skills/aped-*` from pre-3.7.5 installs); update mode fixes wrong-target symlinks and preserves regular files at the target path.

Re-run `aped-method symlink` at any time to repair or rebuild the symlink trees after creating a new `.opencode` / `.agents` / `.codex` marker.

## Integrations

### Ticket systems

| Provider | Fetch | Commit format | Auto-link |
|----------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| `linear` | linear-cli / API | `feat(TEAM-XX): …` | `Part of TEAM-XX` / `Fixes TEAM-XX` |
| `jira` | curl to Jira API | `feat(PROJ-XX): …` | Smart commits |
| `github-issues` | `gh issue view` | `feat(#XX): …` | `Closes #XX` / `Fixes #XX` |
| `gitlab-issues` | `glab issue view` | `feat(#XX): …` | `Closes #XX` |
| `none` | — | `feat: …` | — |

Flow: `/aped-epics` seeds milestones + issues with labels (🆕 / 🔄 / 🔁) and sizes (S/M/L). `/aped-story` fetches the ticket (the team may have edited it — the ticket wins). `/aped-dev` fetches again before implementation; any divergence HALTs until resolved. `/aped-review` posts the review report as a comment and updates status.

### Git providers

| Provider | PR/MR creation | Branch strategy |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| `github` | `gh pr create` | `feature/{ticket}-{slug}` |
| `gitlab` | `glab mr create` | `feature/{ticket}-{slug}` |
| `bitbucket` | Web UI | `feature/{ticket}-{slug}` |

### MCP tools

- **`react-grab-mcp`** — live component inspection for UX design, visual verification in `/aped-dev` (at every GREEN pass on frontend tasks) and validation in `/aped-review` (Aria specialist).

## Hooks

Core APED installs two hooks into `.claude/settings.local.json`:

### `guardrail.sh` — UserPromptSubmit (advisory)

Every prompt is intercepted. The hook checks pipeline coherence against `state.yaml` and actual story statuses, injects advisory context, and never blocks. It honours `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` and validates `current_phase` against a whitelist (`none` / `analyze` / `prd` / `ux` / `architecture` / `sprint`) to reject any garbage.

| Situation | Reaction |
|-----------|----------|
| Coding without epics | Warns: run Analyze → PRD → Epics first |
| PRD without brief | Warns: run `/aped-analyze` first |
| Epics without PRD | Warns: run `/aped-prd` first |
| Review without a story in review status | Warns: run `/aped-dev` first |
| Modifying PRD during sprint | Warns: use `/aped-course` for scope changes |
| Quick fix request | Bypasses (that's what `/aped-quick` is for) |

Timeout 5s; JSON encoding prefers `jq` → `node` (no regex fallback, no context injection risk).

### `upstream-lock.sh` — PreToolUse (enforcement)

Matches `Write | Edit | NotebookEdit`. Denies any write into `prd.md` / `architecture.md` / `product-brief.md` / `ux/*` while any story in `state.yaml` has status `in-progress`. Only `/aped-course` can set `sprint.scope_change_active: true` to temporarily unlock; the skill is responsible for clearing the flag and invalidating epic-context caches before exit.

This is what makes parallel sprint safe: several worktrees can implement on the upstream contract without risk of mid-sprint rug-pulls.

### Optional hooks

These are installed explicitly when you want them:

- `aped-method safe-bash` adds a focused `PreToolUse` Bash validator for obviously dangerous shell commands (`rm -rf /`, `rm -rf $HOME`, `curl | bash`, disk utilities, broad `chmod -R 777`, and `sudo` confirmation). **Best-effort UX safety net, not a security boundary** — crafted commands bypass it trivially. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for scope and limits.
- `aped-method post-edit-typescript` adds a `PostToolUse` hook for `Write|Edit|MultiEdit` that detects TypeScript files and runs local `prettier --write` / `eslint --fix` only when those binaries are already available in the project. Silent no-op when they are not installed.
- `aped-method statusline` installs a Claude Code status line that renders the current APED phase, active epic / story, review queue, worktree count, and git branch from `docs/aped/state.yaml`. If a `statusLine` is already configured, the install prompts before overwriting.
- `aped-method verify-claims` adds a `PostToolUse` Bash advisory hook that scans tool output for the 9 forbidden completion phrases (`should work`, `looks good`, `Done!`, `Perfect!`, etc.) when no evidence pattern (test output, exit 0, `✓`, `PASS`) is found within `verify_claims.evidence_window` lines. Never blocks; advisory only. Configurable via `verify_claims.enabled` in `config.yaml`.
- `aped-method session-start` adds a `SessionStart` hook (matchers `startup|clear|compact`) that reads `aped/skills/SKILL-INDEX.md` and emits its content as `additionalContext`. The skill index is generated deterministically at scaffold time. Disable via `skill_invocation_discipline.enabled: false` in `config.yaml`.
- `aped-method visual-companion` ships a bash + python3 HTTP server (`aped/visual-companion/start-server.sh`) that serves `frame-template.html` with the CSS classes (`.options`, `.cards`, `.mockup`, `.mock-*`) used by `/aped-brainstorm` for browser-based mockup/diagram rendering. Port from `config.yaml visual_companion.port` (default 3737). Localhost-only. No auto-launch in default scaffold.

## Install / Update / Fresh

```bash
# First install
npx aped-method

# Re-run on an existing project — auto-detects and offers:
#   1. Update engine    (upgrade skills/scripts/hooks, preserve state + artifacts)
#   2. Fresh install    (wipe everything, start over — creates a tar.gz backup first)
#   3. Cancel

# Non-interactive
npx aped-method --yes                      # Auto-update if exists, else install
npx aped-method --yes --update             # Explicit update
npx aped-method --yes --fresh              # Nuke and redo (with backup)

# Version / help
npx aped-method --version
npx aped-method --help
```

Flags honour `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR`. Exit codes are meaningful: `0` success, `1` user error, `2` internal error, `130` user cancellation.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
- Node.js ≥ 20
- **Unix-like shell** — APED's hooks and scripts target macOS and Linux (incl. WSL). Native Windows (cmd / PowerShell without WSL) is not supported: the bash scripts use POSIX tools (`stat -c`/`stat -f`, `mkdir`-based locking, `tmux`/`workmux`) that don't have native equivalents.

### Recommended companion tools

- **[workmux](https://github.com/raine/workmux)** — enables the parallel-sprint sweet spot: `/aped-sprint` auto-creates tmux windows with Claude Code pre-launched in each worktree. Install with `brew install raine/workmux/workmux` (macOS/Linux). Fully optional: APED falls back to manual worktree + terminal instructions if absent.
- **[yq](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq)** (v4) — strongly recommended for `/aped-sprint`/`/aped-lead`/`/aped-ship`: state.yaml mutations and reads use yq when present, with a more fragile awk fallback otherwise. Install with `brew install yq` (macOS) or `snap install yq` (Linux).
- **[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)** — speeds up the guardrail hooks' JSON encoding and the audit log writer (`scripts/log.sh`). Optional; APED falls back to defensive shell quoting otherwise.
